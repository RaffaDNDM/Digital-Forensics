# Supertimeline Extractor
The program gathers supertimelines from `.vmdk` files contained in a subfolder of the current path, different from `Dump`.
The program requires that **log2timeline.py** is correctly installed in the same folder of the program.

## Execution
To run the program, you need to type for example this command on bash:
```bash
python3 supertimeline_extractor.py 
```
